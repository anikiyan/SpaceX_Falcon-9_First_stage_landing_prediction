## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket has revolutionized the cost structure of space missions. By analyzing historical launch data, the goal is to predict whether a first stage will land successfully, providing valuable insights that can be used by other companies or organizations that wish to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.
